# Power-BI-Maryland

## Brief Introduction
Thousands of people get pulled over each year in Maryland for various reasons. However, it is interesting to know the result of these stops after the stop. Thus, I have developed a small project to try and address this problem. 
The following project is related to traffic stops and their outcomes, where various predictors are used to predict the outcome of a given traffic stop. This involves using Power BI, DAX, Excel, DAX studio, Power Query, and Python to clean and analyze data and then predict outcomes.

Aside from this, the data set is derived from another dataset and is based on an arrest dataset from a county in Maryland. It is important to note that the data set does not represent traffic stops across the USA and applies only to the Maryland County from which this dataset originates. 

Therefore, the dataset will be cleaned and analyzed, and predictions will be attempted. Also, some of the steps used to get to the outcome will be briefly discussed.
